# **"There Is No List"**

**Spoon Boy:** Do not try and bend the list. That's impossible. Instead . . . only try to realize the truth.  
**Neo:** What truth?  
**Spoon Boy:** There is no list.  
**Neo:** There is no list?  
**Spoon Boy:** Then you'll see that it is not the list that bends; it is only yourself.
